## Contributing to droidconKE



We'd love to accept your patches! 

To contribute to droidconKE, simply open a pull request against the [develop branch](https://github.com/droidconKE/droidconKE2019App/tree/develop)



To ensure you that your pull request is accepted:

1. Raise an issue first of what you are working on.
2. Describe your changes in the pull request description.
3. Be consistent with the coding style being used.
4. Make commits of logical units.
5. Write descriptive commit messages and not 2 worded commits.
6. Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
7. Add tests for all the changes made to make sure that everything works as expected.
8. We will also do thorough testing on our end so that broken code is not pushed.



### NOTE
```

*Add BELOW IF YOU HAD STARTED BY WRITING TESTS. otherwise, ignore*
* Write tests:
  * new features should include tests
  * changes to existing code should be reflected in the tests
  * code coverage should not decrease
  * run **all** the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
  
```
